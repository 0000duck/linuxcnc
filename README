Mission Statement
-----------------

EMC2 is an offshoot of the original NIST Enhanced Machine
Controller.  The new version is (primarily) a GPL'd project.
The major goals are:

1)  Make the project more friendly to new developers.  This
    means a simpler build process, as well as other changes
    listed below.

2)  Reduce complexity by eliminating support for platforms
    other than Linux on x86, with either RTAI or RTLinux for
    realtime.

3)  Incorporate a Hardware Abstraction Layer that makes the
    realtime code more modular and allows pins and I/O devices
    to be reconfigured easily.

4)  Add some of the features that were discussed at the 2003
    NAMES show on EMC Monday - these include rigid tapping
    and single point threading, improved contouring, a built-
    in PLC using ClassicLadder, and others.


The Build Process
-----------------

The build process follows the standard Linux convention:

From the top level directory, run:

./configure
make clean
make


If you have multiple RTAI or RTLinux source directories in /usr/src,
the correct one can be declared as a command line argument:

./configure rtdir=/usr/src/stromboli

configure also accepts other arguments. Use -help to view the list.

Directory Layout
----------------

The directory tree for EMC2 is documented in 'directory.map' in the
top level directory.

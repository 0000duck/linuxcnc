    The available type depends on the firmware packages downloaded
    and if any boards are 'blacklisted'. 
    At least one Mesa board is required as the parallel port
    can't be configured for stepper / servo control. 
    Parallel ports must have the address specified and can
    be specified as 'OUT' or 'IN' which changes the available
    8 data pins between output or input.
    Press the Parport Address Search button to display info on 
    all PCI cards installed. Look for One that mentions Parallel
    port, It should have addresses specified. Choose one and try it.

            It also requires shared axis MPG jogging to be selected.

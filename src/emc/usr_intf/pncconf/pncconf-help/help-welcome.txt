Welcome to PNCCONF a graphical configuration program for EMC2.

             ALPHA Version
Alpha means that there are probably bugs and that some features
are not finished. Please give feed back to the mailing list
or EMC forum.

Pncconf is used to configure a servo or hardware stepper system 
using Mesa I / O cards with the Hostmot2 driver, and parallel ports.

Pncconf require the mesa firmwares to be installed and a realtime 
kernal for tests.
This Alpha version requires you to create a link to the mesa 
firmware file:

sudo ln -s <path to trunk>/src/hal/drivers/mesa-hostmot2/firmware /lib/firmware/hm2-dev

HAL Component Page

Use this page to load extra HAL components 
    for custom HAL files

    The first selection is components that pncconf
        uses internally. You may configure pncconf to 
        load extra instances of the components for
        your custom HAL file. Select the number of
        instances your custom file will need, pncconf
        will add what it needs after them. Meaning
        if you need 2 and pncconf needs 1 pncconf will 
        load 3 instances and use the last one.

Custom Component Commands:
    This selection will allow you to load HAL 
        components that pncconf does not use.
    The first five allow single line component
        loading and single line thread commands.
        you may choose the thread speed.
    The sixth allows single line component loading
        and multiple line thread commands.
        you mayalso select the thread speed.
    The components will be added to the thread 
        between reading of inputs and writing of 
        outputs, in the order you write them.

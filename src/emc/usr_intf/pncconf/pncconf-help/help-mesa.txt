** Mesa setup page **

 * Configuration Tab *
    allows you to choose the board,firmware,
    number of components / gpio, 
    frequency of pwm / pdm and the watchdog timeout
    pick the board you want to use then the firmware and 
    you will see the component numbers change   
    default is to have all the available components active. 
    by choosing less of each component frees up gpio
    press 'accept component changes' to have the connector 
    tabs reflect the changes
    any signalnames you had already pick will be lost unless 
    the component is the same as before the change
    Depending on the board chosen, the tabs will dim if not 
    available.

 * Connector Tabs *
    The available tabs are selected based on the 
    mesa card type
    The available component types are based on the 
    firmware / component number selected on the setup page
    will display the signal names and the component type:
    If the type is:

    GPIO   general purpose Input / output 
        then you may choose between input,output,and opendrain

    PWM GEN 
        you may choose between pwm and pdm

    STEP GENs
         at the moment only support step and direction

    ENCODERS 
        only quadrature.
 
    You could change these options in a custom HAL file
    If you wish to connect a component to something in a 
    custom HAL file write a unique signal name in the combo 
    entry box certain components will add endings to your 
    custom signal name, such as the encoder will 
    add -position -count -velocity -index-enable and -reset

 * Mesa Components / pintypes *


    There are four major pintypes based on the 
    components available:

    * GPIO - general purpose input / output

        You can select the type in the pintype combobox
        This includes GPIOI - input, GPIOO - output, and 
        GPIOD - open drain output
        The available signals will change if you switch between 
        GPIOI and GPIOO/GPIOD.

    * ENCODER - a hardware base quadrature counter

        You select the A phase signal and the rest of the 
        phases (B, I, and possibly M) are automatically included

    * STEPGEN - a hardware based step and direction generator

        Right now only step and direction stepgens are selectable 
        (you could override that in a custom HAL file)
        You select the STEP signal and the direction and enable
         signals are automatically setup

    * PWMGEN - a hardware base pulse width (or density) 
        modulation generator

        You can select PWM or PWD in the pintype combobox
        you select the PULSE signal and the direction and enable 
        signals are automatically setup

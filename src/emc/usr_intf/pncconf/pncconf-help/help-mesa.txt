Mesa setup page:

Configuration Tab:
    allows you to choose the board,firmware,
    number of components / gpio, 
    frequency of pwm / pdm and the watchdog timeout
    pick the board you want to use then the firmware and 
    you will see the component numbers change   
    default is to have all the available components active. 
    by choosing less of each component frees up gpio
    press 'accept component changes' to have the connector 
    tabs reflect the changes
    any signalnames you had already pick will be lost unless 
    the component is the same as before the change
    Depending on the board chosen, the connector tabs will disapear
    if not available.
    The help page output tab will show the firmware PIN file.

Connector Tabs:
    The available tabs are selected based on the 
    mesa card type
    The available component types are based on the 
    firmware / component number selected on the setup page
    will display the signal names and the component type:
    There are four major pintypes based on the 
    components available:

     GPIO - general purpose input / output

        You can select the type in the pintype combobox
        This includes GPIOI - input, GPIOO - output, and 
        GPIOD - open drain output
        The available signals will change if you switch between 
        GPIOI and GPIOO/GPIOD.

     ENCODER - a hardware base quadrature counter

        You select the A phase signal and the rest of the 
        phases (B, I, and possibly M) are automatically included

     PWMGEN - a hardware base pulse width (or density) 
        modulation generator

        You can select PWM or PWD in the pintype combobox
        you select the PULSE signal and the direction and enable 
        signals are automatically setup

     3 PWMGEN - special pwm generators used for driving brushless
        servo motor windings directly.

     STEPGEN - a hardware based step and direction generator

        only step and direction stepgens are supported
        (you could override that in a custom HAL file)
        You select the STEP signal and the direction and enable
        signals are automatically setup

    You could change these options in a custom HAL file
    If you wish to connect a component to something in a 
    custom HAL file write a unique signal name in the combo 
    entry box certain components will add endings to your 
    custom signal name, such as the encoder will 
    add -position -count -velocity -index-enable and -reset

the dtc which comes from apt-get install device-tree-compiler is useless
there is a working dtc in the angstrom distro which we dont use
so have to build it ourselves

this directory is copied from the kernel repo (3.8.13-bone18) scripts/dtc
with a hand-crafted Makefile to build dtc

after building, see the devicetree directory

    Improved load-time sanity checking.

    Improved handling of "zero instances enabled" situations.


0.1 (released 2008-05-13)

    Split m7i43_hm2 0.4 into a generic hostmot2 driver and a low-level I/O
    driver for the 7i43 (called hm2_7i43).  Moved the firmware loading
    on the 7i43 from the kernel driver to userspace, by extending the
    bfload program.

    Wrote a new driver that plugs the 5i20 board into the hostmot2 driver.
    Firmware loading on the 5i20 was already supported by bfload.

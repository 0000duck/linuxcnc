    hm2_5i20 0.4

    Add support for the 4i65 Anything I/O board (in the now mis-named
    hm2_5i20 driver).  The 4i65 just like the 5i20, except the PCI
    Subsystem Device ID is different and the first I/O connector is
    named P1 instead of P2.

    hostmot2 0.11

    This fixes a bug in pwmgen so that .scale works as expected.


released 2008-08-22
    hostmot2 0.10

    Added stepgen.maxaccel.

    This version of the stepgen position controller and velocity slewing
    code is the least broken one yet.

    Added stepgen.velocity_cmd (not writable, just for peeking at what
    the velocity slewing code is doing).


released 2008-08-21
    hostmot2 0.9

    Fixed stepgen.stepspace, it was not getting set correctly on the FPGA.

    Fixed stepgen.position-fb, it was not getting set reported correctly
    to HAL.

    Added stepgen.maxvel.

    Added raw.dump_state, a way to cause hostmot2 to dump its internal
    state to the syslog.


released 2008-08-19
    hostmot2 0.8

    Changed the stepgen timing parameters from "float seconds" to
    "u32 nanoseconds".  This breaks existing configs that use stepgen!

    Added an "enable" pin for stepgen.

    Fixed a harmless buglet in the Master DDS stepgen fix that went
    into 0.6.

    Segregated the stepgen debug pins to make things clearer.


released 2008-08-17
    hostmot2 0.7

    Give HAL interfaces to all IO pins, not just the full GPIOs.  IO pins
    used by active module instances have restricted interfaces.

    Improved IO Port handling.  Support open-drain pins.

    Updated README to reflect reality.

    Report firmware timestamp when loading.

    Improved config string parsing.


released 2008-08-15
    hostmot2 0.6

    Fix a bug in the stepgen driver.  Stepgen now works on both the 5i20
    and the 7i43.


released 2008-08-13
    hostmot2 0.5
    hm2_5i20 0.3

    The llios now export a "threadsafe" flag.  If it's set, hostmot2
    exports an additional pair of functions to read & write just the
    gpios.  The 5i20 supports this, but the 7i43 does not.

    5i20: mark driver as threadsafe.


0.4 (released 2008-08-03)

    Moved firmware loading from userspace to the kernel.  The low-level
    I/O drivers (hm2_5i20 & hm2_7i43) register a "program_fpga()"
    function with the hostmot2 driver, and request a firmware file in
    their config string.  The hostmot2 driver fetches the firmware with
    request_firmware()/udev, validates the bitfile, and feeds it to the
    llio's program_fpga() function.

    hm2_5i20 and hm2_7i43 now supply a program_fpga() function, used by
    the high-level firmware driver to program them when they register.

    hm2_5i20:

	Improved board-detection-time error handling.

	Added the LASxBRD #READY fix from bfload.

    hm2_7i43:

	Now detects the board's FPGA (needed for firmware programming).


0.3 (released 2008-06-17)

    Added support for Raw mode (lets you peek & poke the hostmot2 firmware
    from HAL).


0.2 (released 2008-05-25)

    Improved load-time sanity checking.

    Improved handling of "zero instances enabled" situations.


0.1 (released 2008-05-13)

    Split m7i43_hm2 0.4 into a generic hostmot2 driver and a low-level I/O
    driver for the 7i43 (called hm2_7i43).  Moved the firmware loading
    on the 7i43 from the kernel driver to userspace, by extending the
    bfload program.

    Wrote a new driver that plugs the 5i20 board into the hostmot2 driver.
    Firmware loading on the 5i20 was already supported by bfload.

    hostmot2 0.4.1

    Merge stepgen fix from TRUNK.


0.4 (released 2008-08-03)

    Moved firmware loading from userspace to the kernel.  The low-level
    I/O drivers (hm2_5i20 & hm2_7i43) register a "program_fpga()"
    function with the hostmot2 driver, and request a firmware file in
    their config string.  The hostmot2 driver fetches the firmware with
    request_firmware()/udev, validates the bitfile, and feeds it to the
    llio's program_fpga() function.

    hm2_5i20 and hm2_7i43 now supply a program_fpga() function, used by
    the high-level firmware driver to program them when they register.

    hm2_5i20:

	Improved board-detection-time error handling.

	Added the LASxBRD #READY fix from bfload.

    hm2_7i43:

	Now detects the board's FPGA (needed for firmware programming).


0.3 (released 2008-06-17)

    Added support for Raw mode (lets you peek & poke the hostmot2 firmware
    from HAL).


0.2 (released 2008-05-25)

    Improved load-time sanity checking.

    Improved handling of "zero instances enabled" situations.


0.1 (released 2008-05-13)

    Split m7i43_hm2 0.4 into a generic hostmot2 driver and a low-level I/O
    driver for the 7i43 (called hm2_7i43).  Moved the firmware loading
    on the 7i43 from the kernel driver to userspace, by extending the
    bfload program.

    Wrote a new driver that plugs the 5i20 board into the hostmot2 driver.
    Firmware loading on the 5i20 was already supported by bfload.

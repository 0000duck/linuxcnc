This directory contains a shared library that user interfaces use for
communicating with the LinuxCNC controller ("task").

User interfaces (and other programs that want to drive linuxcnc) can
#include linuxcnc-ui.h, link against liblinuxcnc-ui.so, and call the
functions in there to interact with the controller.

The linuxcnc-ui library is released under the LGPL (Library GPL) license.
This means that linking your application to liblinuxcnc-ui does not
require you to open-source your UI (though we'd appreciate it if you did).


To do:

    emc/nml_intf/emcargs.cc should move into some kind of helper library

        sets the global 'inifile' from '-ini FILENAME' on the commandline.

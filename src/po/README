Note for translators of the pot files.

Please make a copy of the pot file renaming it to reflect the language it is
being translated in to. For example, for a German translation of rs274_err.pot,
your working file would be de_rs274_err.po - If the file does not exist within
the CVS repository, then feel free to create one from a *.pot template.

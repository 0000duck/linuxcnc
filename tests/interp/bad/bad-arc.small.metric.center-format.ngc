;Radius to end of arc differs from radius to start: start=(X0.0000,Y0.0000) center=(X0.0325,Y0.0000) end=(X0.0400,Y0.0000) r1=0.0325 r2=0.0075 abs_err=0.025 rel_err=76.9231%
;
; There are two components to the radius error tolerance for center-format
; arcs.  The "absolute error" is the difference between the radius at the
; starting point and the radius at the ending point.  The "relative error"
; is the absolute error divided by the maximum arc radius.
;
; An arc fails the radius tolerance test if either of these conditions is
; true:
;     * The absolute error is greater than 2 * 0.01 * sqrt(2) mm, or
;     * The relative error is greater than 0.75 (75%)

;Radius to end of arc differs from radius to start: start=(X0.0000,Y0.0000) center=(X100.0250,Y0.0000) end=(X200.0000,Y0.0000) r1=100.0250 r2=99.9750 abs_err=0.0501 rel_err=0.0501%
;
; There are two components to the radius error tolerance for center-format
; arcs.  The "absolute error" is the difference between the radius at the
; starting point and the radius at the ending point.  The "relative error"
; is the absolute error divided by the maximum arc radius.
;
; An arc fails the radius tolerance test if either of these conditions is
; true:
;     * The absolute error is greater than 0.05 inches, or
;     * The absolute error is greater than 0.0005 inches and the relative
;       error is greater than 0.001 (0.1%).

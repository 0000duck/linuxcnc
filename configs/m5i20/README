The M5i20 configuration is for servo machines using a
board manufactured by Mesa electronics.  This sample
configuration includes 4 axes of motion, several additional
encoder reading routines, as well as additional IO.

This board reads its fpga code from the PC at the time
of startup.  A sample fpga configuration is included and
will be loaded when the EMC2 starts.

You must have a M5i20 card in order for this configuration
to start.

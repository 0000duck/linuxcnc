These sim configurations demonstrate use of an XHC-HB04 wireless MPG pendant in LinuxCNC using a HAL module created by Frederic Rible (frible@teaser.fr) (Copyright (C) 2013).  Ref:

The HAL module is designed for the XHC-HB04 V3.0 identified as USB device 10CE:EB70.
Most of the pendant features are handled:
- buttons converted to hal pins
- jog wheel with variable scale (use STEP button to change in 1 10 100 1000 sequence)
- LCD screen displays machine and relative positions

Sim configurations are provided for two known button configurations:

layout1 -- 16 buttons
layout2 -- 18 buttons (more common)

A working and connected xhc-hb04 device is required for the demonstration.  If not connected, the sim configs will start without pendant functionality.

A udev rules file:
  /etc/udev/rules.d/90-xhc.rules
must be added to the system to give correct user permissions for USB access:
SYSFS{idProduct}=="eb70", SYSFS{idVendor}=="10ce", MODE="666", OWNER="root", GROUP="users"

Or for later operating systems (like ubuntu12.x):
ATTR{idProduct}=="eb70", ATTR{idVendor}=="10ce", MODE="666", OWNER="root", GROUP="users"

The sim configurations use a single halfile: xhc-hb04.tcl.  This halfile uses a custom comp file (xhc_hb04_util.comp) and can be added to existing configurations by adding an ini file entry for:
  [HAL]HALFILE=xhc-hb04.tcl

This HALFILE entry should follow other HALFILE entries.

Optional configuration ini file items and the defaults values are:

[XHC_HB04_CONFIG]
layout     = 2       (1|2)
coords     = x y z a (4 max)
coefs      = 1 1 1 1 (filter coefs 0 < coef < 1)
scales     = 1 1 1 1 (plus/minus factors)
threadname = servo-thread

The filter coefs can be used to slow the response to wheel steps but are usually not needed since the xhc-hb04 component implements smoothing.  The movement per wheel increment is set with the STEP button (1 10 100 1000).  The scale factor for each axis can be set with the scales item.

Pendant buttons are connected to hal pins with ini file items.
Examples:
[XHC_HB04_BUTTONS]
step        = xhc-hb04.stepsize-up
stop        = halui.program.stop
rewind      = halui.program.step
goto-zero   = halui.mdi-command-00
macro-1     = halui.mdi-command-01
mode        = ""  (placeholder)

Note: MDI commands are defined in a [HALUI] stanza:
[HALUI]
MDI_COMMAND = G0 X0 Y0 Z0
MDI_COMMAND = M101

An xhc-hb04 pendant can be added to existing configurations.
  1) copy files to the configuration directory:
     $ cp xhc-hb04.tcl         your_config_dir/
     $ cp xhc-hb04-layout*.cfg your_config_dir/
  2) Edit existing configuration ini file to:
    a) add [HAL]HALFILE=xhc-hb04.tcl
    b) add stanza [XHC-HB04_CONFIG]
    c) add stanza [XHC-HB04_BUTTONS]
    c) add or update stanza for [HALUI]

See the demo ini files for more detailed examples.

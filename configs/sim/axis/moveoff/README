moveoff.comp is a 'Hal-only' method for providing offsets for up to nine axes (x,y,z,a,b,c,u,v,w).

The component can be used to add offsets to the machine postion when a running program is paused.

The moveoff.comp component provides min, max, velocity, and acceleration limits for each axis (similar to the limit3 component).

See the manpage for more informaion:

$ man moveoff

The demonstration configs show:
  o moveoff.hal - a halfile to connect to the moveoff component
  o moveoff_gui - a simple gui with controls
  o moveoff_gui - interfaced to simulated external controls
  o hookup_moveoff.tcl - a script to connect the moveoff component
  o moveoff.halscope - halscope configs to illustrate movement
    (GUI's to not show Hal-only offset movements)

Demonstration configs:

demo1 moveoff.hal, sim_pin for control pins and axis 2

demo2 moveoff.hal, moveoff_gui with controls
demo3 moveoff.hal, moveoff_gui with simulated external controls

demo4 hookup_moveoff.tcl, moveoff_gui with controls
demo5 hookup_moveoff.tcl, moveoff_gui with simulated external controls

demo6 is similar to demo4 but uses a halfile named removeshort.tcl to verify operation of hookup_moveoff.tcl for 'servo-like' hal configurations

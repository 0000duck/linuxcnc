Moveoff demo -- fixed retract on single axis (Z)

Demo:
  1) Start application (axis gui)
  2) The little sim_pin gui SIMULATES an
     external toggle switch that connected
     to the external_enable signal.  This
     signal enables/disables offsets
     when the machine is paused.
  3) Start program
  4) Pause program
  5) A moveoff_gui display will appear showing
     the current Z offset
  6) Toggle the sim_pin external_enable to 1 (ON) to 
     apply the fixed offset.
  7) Toggle the sim_pin external_enable to 0 (OFF) to
     remove the fixed offset.
     The program can not be resumed until the offset
     is removed.
  8) The fixed offset will be removed after
     a delay to allow for spindle reactivation.
     Typically, the spindle would be gated
     off for the duration of the pause using
     the mv.apply-offsets pin

Moveoff_gui options:

  onpause  -- offsets when program paused
  local    -- local controls

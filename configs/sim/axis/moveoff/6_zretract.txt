Moveoff demo -- fixed retract on single axis (Z)

Demo:
  1) Start application (axis gui)
  2) The sim_pin gui simulates an external toggle
     switch connected to the external_enable
     signal.  This signal enables/disables offsets
     when the machine is paused.
  3) Start program
  4) Pause program
  5) A moveoff_gui display (with no controls) will
     appear showing the current Z offset
  6) Toggle the sim_pin external_enable to 0 (OFF) to
     remove the fixed offset and resume the program.
  7) The fixed offset will be removed after
     a delay to allow for spindle reactivation.
     Typically, the spindle would be gated
     off for the duration the mv.offset-applied pin.
     The delay allows time for the spindle to resume
     speed.
  8) Toggle the sim_pin external_enable switch to
     1 (ON) to allow offsetting at the next program
     pause -- or leave it OFF to require its
     activation on the next program pause.

The ini file sets:
  1) offset amount and its velocity and acceleration
  2) state of the external-enable signal at starup
  3) autoresume delay interval
  4) location and size of the moveoff_gui display

The sim configuration is a set of files
that makes up a very basic EMC2 using
ini, tbl, var, and a single hal file
for simulated limit switches.  It also
finds a file in configs/common that is
a core_sim.hal.  This file provides that
functionality in common with other
configurations.

Select this if you have no functional machine 
but want to edit some basic configuration stuff
or play with one of the EMC2 displays.

There is also a more complex simulated machine
called "servo_sim" that has full PID loops and
simulated motors and encoders.  This "machine"
can be used for more sophisticated testing 
and tuning.

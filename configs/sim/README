The sim set of files sets up a very basic EMC2 using ini, tbl, var, and a single hal file for simulated limit switches.  It also finds a file in configs/common that is a core_sim.hal and provides that functionality in common with other configurations.

Select this if you have no fucnctional machine but want to edit some basic configuration stuff or play with one of the EMC2 the displays.

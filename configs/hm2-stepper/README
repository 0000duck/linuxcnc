This configuration drives a 3-axis stepper machine using a Mesa Anything
IO board with the HostMot2 firmware.  No limit switches are used, so
this should work with very basic hardware.

These configs have 0 Encoders, 0 PWMs, and 3 StepGens 

5i22-big   For the 1.5M gate version

5i22-small For the 1.0M gate version

7i43-big   For the 400k gate version

7i43-small For the 200k gate version

The config will only run if you have the card installed.

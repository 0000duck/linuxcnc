Here are some quick and dirty HAL config files for hostmot2.

This is what I use for my driver testing.  I don't have a machine to run
them on, I just have some little servos and steppers on my workbench.
Both HAL files set up one servo as a simple MPG, and slave all other
motors to it.  So this is more an example of naming schemes and HAL
objects than it is a configuration for a machine.

I run one or the other of these HAL files with "halcmd -f".  Both expect
to find some information in environment variables, so this needs to be
set up before you can load the HAL files.  The environment variables
are described in comments at the top of each .hal file.

This config is "stepper" with the addition of ClassicLadder
connections to some of the EMC IO.  
It is based on the classicladder stepper sample config but includes a charge pump and 
a Torch Height Control system for Bob Cambells THC300 and CandCNC THC systems.
The stepper pinouts are for a standard breakout board/combo board as provided by Bob Campbell.

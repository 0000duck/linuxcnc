This file is a place holder until we get a description of
the setup from someone who knows.  If you are that person,
then get it in here.

We need to know any differences between the 100 and Lite
versions as well as running multiple cards.

Multiple cards are supported by reading the board id jumper
settings and using them as the <boardId> in the exported
HAL names. There are two jumers on J3 of the motenc-100
board that are defined as the board id. Installing a jumper
causes the correspoding bit to read as zero. Since there are
two board id jumpers, up to four cards are supported. Using
the board id allows the configuration to be independant of
which PCI slot the card is plugged into.

This configuration will require one of these cards at the
time of startup.

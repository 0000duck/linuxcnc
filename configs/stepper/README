This configuration step is intended for basic stepper machines.
You can have either standard pinout (EMC style) or xylotex pinout, by including 
either one of those 2 .hal files. Certainly you could make a new one which would 
suit your own custom cabling.
There are 2 ini files, one for inch setups (stepper_in.ini) and one for metric 
setups (stepper_mm.ini).

Detailed description:

* ini files

-- stepper_in.ini - inch setup for a stepper machine

-- stepper_mm.ini - metric setup for a stepper machine

* nml files

-- it uses a default nml file (found in configs/common/emc.nml)

* hal files

-- it uses a default stepper hal file (configs/common/core_stepper.hal)

-- standard_pinout.hal - include this from the ini to get you a standard pinout

-- xylotex_pinout.hal -  include this from the ini to get you a xylotex pinout (e.g. step/dir are inverted)

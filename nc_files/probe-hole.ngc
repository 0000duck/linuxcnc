(For this code to yield accurate results, the probe shank must be well-aligned with the Z-axis,)
(the cross section of the probe tip at its widest point must be very circular, )
(and the probe tip radius i.e., the radius of the circular cross section must be known precisely.)
(If the probe tip radius is known only approximately but the other conditions hold, the location )
(of the hole center will still be accurate, but the hole diameter will not.)

(An entry of the form <description of number> is meant to be replaced by an actual number that)
(matches the description of number. After this section of code has executed, the X-value of the)
(center will be in parameter 1041, the Y-value of the center in parameter 1022,)
(and the diameter in parameter 1034.)
(In addition, the diameter parallel to the X-axis will be in parameter 1024,)
(the diameter parallel to the Y-axis in parameter 1014,)
(and the difference which is an indicator of circularity in parameter 1035.)
(The probe tip will be in the hole at the XY center of the hole.)

(The example does not include a tool change to put a probe in the spindle.)
(Add the tool change code at the beginning, if needed.)

(Note that this code will not function until you replace <description of number> with a number)

(probe to find center and diameter of circular hole)
(This program will not run as given here. You have to)
(insert numbers in place of <description of number>.)
(Delete lines N020, N030, and N040 when you do that.)

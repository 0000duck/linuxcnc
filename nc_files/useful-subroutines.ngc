(O100: "hole drilling" with an end mill)



o100 sub
  (helical hole milling, load tool and set feed first, then use like so:)
  (o100 call [x pos] [y pos] [safety height] [hole depth] [hole dia] [tool dia])
  (tool dia doesn't have to be specified exactly.)
#7=[#6/2] (#7 is depth per circle = half of tool diameter)
#8=#7     (#8 is current depth step)

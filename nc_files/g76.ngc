(p = thread pitch, distance per revolution)
(z = end of drive line)
(i = offset from drive line to thread peaks)
(    negative i means the threads are at a smaller radius than the drive line,)
(    so i is negative for outside threads, positive for inside threads)
(j = initial cut depth; subsequent depths follow degression formula)
(r = depth degression: 1.0 = constant depth, 2.0 = constant area)
(                      any number >= 1.0 allowed)
(k = full thread depth)
(q = "compound slide" angle)
(h = number of spring passes)

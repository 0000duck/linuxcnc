(cut a small 1/4-20 thread and part it)
(t1 is for facing and left turning, t6 is threading tool, t9 parting)
(proper tool offsets should be set in the tool table!)

(p = thread pitch, distance per revolution)
(z = end of drive line)
(i = offset from drive line to thread peaks)
(    negative i means the threads are at a smaller radius than the drive line,)
(    so i is negative for outside threads, positive for inside threads)
(j = initial cut depth; subsequent depths follow degression formula)
(r = depth degression: 1.0 = constant depth, 2.0 = constant area)
(                      any number >= 1.0 allowed)
(k = full thread depth)
(q = "compound slide" angle)
(h = number of spring passes)
(e = distance along drive line used for tapered start/end)
(l = which ends get the taper: 0 = neither, 1 = begin, 2 = end, 3 = both)

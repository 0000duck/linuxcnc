== NAME

rtapi_open_as_root - Open a file with permissions of UID0

== SYNOPSIS

int **rtapi_open_as_root**(const char *__filename__, int __mode__)

== ARGUMENTS
filename::
mode::
    As for open(2)

== DESCRIPTION
By default, rtapi_app performs filesystem access with the permissions of the
user who invoked rtapi_app, not as root.  *rtapi_open_as_root* simply
invokes `open`(2) with the specified arguments, but with filesystem permissions
elevated to root access.

This can be used e.g., if a hardware driver requires access to `/dev/mem`.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
Only available for realtime code with "uspace" realtime.  Call only from within
init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.

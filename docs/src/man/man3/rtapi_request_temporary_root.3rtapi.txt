== NAME

rtapi_request_temporary_root - Temporarily switch to UID0 for filesystem access

== SYNOPSIS

void **request_temporary_root**()

== ARGUMENTS
filename::
mode::
    As for open(2)

== DESCRIPTION
By default, rtapi_app performs filesystem access with the permissions of the
user who invoked rtapi_app, not as root.  *rtapi_request_temporary_root*
temporarily elevates filesystem privileges until the corresponding
*rtapi_release_temporary_root* call.  Internally, a count of active root
requests is kept, and only when the number drops to 0 is root access given up.

This can be used e.g., if a hardware driver requires access to `/dev/mem`.
(but if the operation that needs root access is **open**(2) then  use 
**rtapi_open_as_root**(3rtapi) instead.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
Only available for realtime code with "uspace" realtime.  Call only from within
init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.

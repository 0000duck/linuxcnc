= Updating LinuxCNC

This section describes how to upgrade LinuxCNC to version 2.7 from
version 2.6.  It assumes that you have an existing 2.6 install that you
want to update to 2.7.

To upgrade LinuxCNC to version 2.7 from a version older than 2.6,
you have to first upgrade your old install to 2.6, then follow these
instructions to upgrade to 2.7.

If you do not have an old (pre-2.7) version of LinuxCNC to upgrade,
then you're best off making a fresh install of 2.7 as described in the
section <<_getting_linuxcnc,Getting LinuxCNC>>.

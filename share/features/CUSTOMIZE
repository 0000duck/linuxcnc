Customizing to suit your needs

You are encouraged to make changes to some files to work best with
your equipment and material you use.

Following applies only if your catalog is 'mill' or 'lathe'

Defaults.ngc
------------
First change you should do is edit catalogs/'your catalog'/defaults.ngc
Set your values in the metric or imperial section.
To prevent losing your changes when updates are available, 
save the file as defaults_custom.ngc

Features will first search for a custom defaults file and use it if found.
Otherwise it will load the standard file.

Postamble.ngc
-------------
A postamble file is not needed but if you want something to happen
just before M2, write your code in postamble.ngc and save under postamble_custom.ngc
You can also save an empty file or delete it but it will be overwritten
when updating.

postamble_custom.ngc or postamble.ngc will always be loaded
If you want special commands for a single job, use Custom GCode as the last Feature.

Menu.xml
--------
menu.xml can also be edited and saved under menu_custom.xml
Same rule applies for the menu.

What is the advantage of keeping the same name 'mill' or 'lathe' ?
If you change only defaults.ngc, you will always the last options available in your menu.
But if you also change menu.xml you do not much advantages.

If you use a different catalog name, run the sim from time to time.
However ALL .cfg and .ngc available are copied to you Features directory.

One thing you should not neglect is creating a Default Template and saving files as xml
to use as template or import in your tree

to use gladevcp in a run in place environment one must add system links to these files.

in usr/lib/glade3/modules add links for hal_pythonplugin.py hal_widgets.py and led.py

in usr/share/glade3/catalogs add link for led.py

in usr/share/glade3/pixmaps/hicolor/22x22/actions add link for widget_hal_pythonplugin-hal_led.png


When using gladevcp widgets in python programs remember to import hal_pythonplugin

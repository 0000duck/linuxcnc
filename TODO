HAL driver for Vigalent card?
Need docs and a volunteer with a card

Generate sample configs that are functionally equivalent to the following 
EMC1 configs:

Old name   New name    Responsible
sim        sim         JMK
generic    stepper     DONE, JMK to review accel headroom
stg        stg         Alex
motenc     motenc      needs a README: PeteV?

Need to come up with a way to handle "bridgeport" style machines (more I/O than generic)



Choose BASE_PERIOD carefully (larger) for non-stepper configs, especially for 
those that use ISA cards

RTAPI needs a reliable, portable, and high resolution time measurement.  The one provided
by RTAI doesn't do the trick - it seems to have 54mS granularity on my BDI-TNG box, for
example.  And the one provided by the kernel (do_gettimeofday) seems to block for some
folks.  Deferred until we have more time.

A sim mode that works without realtime kernel patches

Improved classicladder GUI

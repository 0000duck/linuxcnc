         JMK

resolve any possible GPL ambiguities
NOT DONE * hal/classicladder - mark files that have been modified JMK/PeteV
DONE     * hal/classicladder/README.txt - add notice "CL has been modified for EMC2,
         report bugs to EMC2 team, not original author" 
NOT DONE * hal/drivers/m5i20_HM5-4E.h - add license notice.  PeteV?
DONE     * hal/drivers/hal_stg - does it use EMC1 code?  credit Fred/Will if so (Alex)
DONE     * hal/drivers/hal_motenc - no EMC1 code used, nothing to do DONE
DONE     * rtapi/vsnpintf.h - came from kernel source, add GPL notice  DONE
DONE     * emc/kinematics prflib.h & trajectory.h - delete, not used  DONE
DONE     * emc/rs274ngc/units.h - add license header & attribution  DONE
         NOTE: units.h duplicates defines in emccanon.cc.  If possible, emccanon.cc
         should use this header instead of duplicating the defines
NOT DONE * tcl/*.tcl - Add GPL notices to files that don't have them

DONE     COPYING - implies that everything is GPL, revise to mention that 
         interfaces are LGPL, also acknowlege EMC1 authors and explain that
         formerly Public Domain EMC1 code is covered under GPL now.  DONE

PENDING  HAL driver for Vigalent card?
         Need docs and a volunteer with a card

Generate sample configs that are functionally equivalent to the following 
EMC1 configs:

Status   Old name   New name    Responsible
DONE     sim        sim         JMK
DONE     generic    stepper     DONE, JMK to review accel headroom

NOT DONE Need to come up with a way to handle "bridgeport" style machines (more I/O than generic)



Choose BASE_PERIOD carefully (larger) for non-stepper configs, especially for 
those that use ISA cards

THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.2)

Investigate/fix missed-deadline reporting??

RTAPI needs a reliable, portable, and high resolution time measurement.  The one provided
by RTAI doesn't do the trick - it seems to have 54mS granularity on my BDI-TNG box, for
example.  And the one provided by the kernel (do_gettimeofday) seems to block for some
folks.  Deferred until we have more time.

A sim mode that works without realtime kernel patches

Improved classicladder GUI

REQUIRED FOR EMC2'S FIRST RELEASE  (EMC-2.0)


DONE     ##Time delay relay for HAL, two pins, in and out
         src/hal/components/timedelay.c

DONE     Finish?/test make install
         https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1053350&group_id=6744&atid=356744
         Working as a normal make install and with debian building 
         by the usual dpkg-buildpackage
 
DONE     Finish cleaning up config directories
         https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1370927&group_id=6744&atid=356744


DONE     Get the config picker/copier tool working
         (basics)

OBSOLETE Get the config picker tool's backup function working (to allow people to send their confi
         when they need support)
         JMK

resolve any possible GPL ambiguities
DONE     * hal/classicladder - mark files that have been modified JMK/PeteV (won't get better:)
DONE     * hal/classicladder/README.txt - add notice "CL has been modified for EMC2,
         report bugs to EMC2 team, not original author" 
DONE     * hal/drivers/m5i20_HM5-4E.h - add license notice.  PeteV? (email that it can be released under GPL)
DONE     * hal/drivers/hal_stg - does it use EMC1 code?  credit Fred/Will if so (Alex)
DONE     * hal/drivers/hal_motenc - no EMC1 code used, nothing to do DONE
DONE     * rtapi/vsnpintf.h - came from kernel source, add GPL notice  DONE
DONE     * emc/kinematics prflib.h & trajectory.h - delete, not used  DONE
DONE     * emc/rs274ngc/units.h - add license header & attribution  DONE
         NOTE: units.h duplicates defines in emccanon.cc.  If possible, emccanon.cc
         should use this header instead of duplicating the defines
DONE     * tcl/*.tcl - Add GPL notices to files that don't have them (ray did this)

DONE     COPYING - implies that everything is GPL, revise to mention that 
         interfaces are LGPL, also acknowlege EMC1 authors and explain that
         formerly Public Domain EMC1 code is covered under GPL now.  DONE

DONE     HAL driver for Vigalent card?
         Need docs and a volunteer with a card / Needs testing

Generate sample configs that are functionally equivalent to the following 
EMC1 configs:

Status   Old name   New name    Responsible
DONE     sim        sim         JMK
DONE     generic    stepper     DONE, JMK to review accel headroom
DONE     stg        stg         Alex (stg1&2)
DONE     motenc     motenc      needs a README: PeteV
DONE     univstep   univstep    DONE
DONE     univpwm    univpwm     RayH, JonE
DONE     -----      step-cl     DONE
DONE     -----      m5i20       petev

NOT DONE Need to come up with a way to handle "bridgeport" style machines (more I/O than generic)


Choose BASE_PERIOD carefully (larger) for non-stepper configs, especially for 
those that use ISA cards

THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.2)

Investigate/fix missed-deadline reporting??
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1372949&group_id=6744&atid=106744
RTAPI needs a reliable, portable, and high resolution time measurement.  The one provided
by RTAI doesn't do the trick - it seems to have 54mS granularity on my BDI-TNG box, for
example.  And the one provided by the kernel (do_gettimeofday) seems to block for some
folks.  Deferred until we have more time.

A sim mode that works without realtime kernel patches

A failed emc run should collect data and give the option of sending it to the developers.

Improved classicladder GUI

Change halcmd to use GNU getline in interactive mode (history, tab completion, etc)

Finish HALUI

Define canonical encoder interface, convert all hardware drivers to use it, convert homing
to use it.

Fixes in HAL modules:
  canonical interfaces and naming conventions

THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.4)

TODO     sort out axis/joints issues: 
	    * limits need to be imposed on joints (tricky with kins)
	    * ini changes 
	    * clean out code (on all different levels, when joints are involved, call them joints..)

TODO     Convert all hardware drivers to use canonical homing, 

Fixes in HAL modules:
TODO     canonical interfaces and naming conventions

DONE

Get the config picker/copier tool working
DONE (basics)

Get the config picker tool's backup function working (to allow people to send their confi
when they need support)
JMK

resolve any possible GPL ambiguities
* hal/classicladder - mark files that have been modified JMK/PeteV
* hal/classicladder/README.txt - add notice "CL has been modified for EMC2,
report bugs to EMC2 team, not original author"  DONE
* hal/drivers/m5i20_HM5-4E.h - add license notice.  PeteV?
* hal/drivers/hal_stg - does it use EMC1 code?  credit Fred/Will if so (alex)
* hal/drivers/hal_motenc - no EMC1 code used, nothing to do DONE
* rtapi/vsnpintf.h - came from kernel source, add GPL notice  DONE
* emc/kinematics prflib.h & trajectory.h - delete, not used  DONE
* emc/rs274ngc/units.h - add license header & attribution  DONE
NOTE: units.h duplicates defines in emccanon.cc.  If possible, emccanon.cc
should use this header instead of duplicating the defines
* tcl/*.tcl - Add GPL notices to files that don't have them

COPYING - implies that everything is GPL, revise to mention that 
interfaces are LGPL, also acknowlege EMC1 authors and explain that
formerly Public Domain EMC1 code is covered under GPL now.  DONE

HAL driver for Vigalent card?
Need docs and a volunteer with a card

Generate sample configs that are functionally equivalent to the following 
EMC1 configs:

Old name   New name    Responsible
sim        sim         JMK
generic    stepper     DONE, JMK to review accel headroom
stg        stg         Alex
motenc     motenc      needs a README: PeteV?
univstep   univstep    DONE
univpwm    univpwm     RayH, JonE
-----      step-cl     DONE
-----      m5i20       ??

Need to come up with a way to handle "bridgeport" style machines (more I/O than generic)



Choose BASE_PERIOD carefully (larger) for non-stepper configs, especially for 
those that use ISA cards

THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.2)

Investigate/fix missed-deadline reporting??

RTAPI needs a reliable, portable, and high resolution time measurement.  The one provided
by RTAI doesn't do the trick - it seems to have 54mS granularity on my BDI-TNG box, for
example.  And the one provided by the kernel (do_gettimeofday) seems to block for some
folks.  Deferred until we have more time.

A sim mode that works without realtime kernel patches

Improved classicladder GUI
